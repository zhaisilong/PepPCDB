# Changelog

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Initialized `peppcdb` as a standalone local deployment project.
- Started project version records at document version `v0.1.0`.
- Added git ignore rules so code and documentation are versioned while large synchronized data assets are excluded.
- Documented the planned deployment data sources and refresh workflow.

### Data Policy

- `filtered_peppi`, SQLite snapshots, SQLite WAL/SHM files, logs, caches, and temporary outputs are not tracked in git.
- Deployment data should be copied or rebuilt during release preparation.
- The preferred pep annotation source for deployment is `function_mannual/affinity/pep_annotations_patched.jsonl`.

### Notes

- The affinity patched annotation file keeps the formal pep annotation row count stable at 13,886 rows.
- The current affinity patch adds `has_affinity=true` and normalized nM `affinity_text` to 1,944 pep annotation rows.
- Patch report issue counts to preserve for review: ambiguous 3, chain unmatched 10, conflicting values 8, entry missing 348, malformed value 1, sequence problem 2.
